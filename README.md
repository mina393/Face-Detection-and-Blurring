# Face-Detection-and-Blurring
This project detects and blurs faces in images, videos, or webcam streams using OpenCV and Mediapipe. It supports three modes: image, video, and live webcam. Detected faces are blurred, and the output is saved in the specified directory. The project is useful for privacy preservation in media content by obscuring faces.
